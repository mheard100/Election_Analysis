# ELECTION ANALYSIS
Create an Election Analysis "PyPoll" with Python
## Overview of Project
A Colorado Board of Elections employee has given you the task to complete the election audit of a recent local congressional election.
Python code is used to analyze an excel csv file with voting data. Things looked for in the data set include:

1. Calculate the total number of votes cast.
2. Get a complete list of candidates who received votes.
3. Calculate the total number of votes each candidate received.
4. Calculate the percentage of votes each candidate won.
5. Determine the winner of the election based on popular vote.

#### Election-Audit Summary
This script should be used by the election commission for future elections. To use for other elections, the file
file path may need to be changed dependent on where it is located in the directory. Furthermore, extracting
candidate names and countys by columns may need to change dependent on the raw data set. This may include 
the header if it is more than one row at the top (i.e There's a title row). With minimum tweaks to the code,
it can be reused over and over again.
